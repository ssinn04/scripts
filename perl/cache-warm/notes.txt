retrieve hosts from gccmdb using pacific.pl and ???
retrieve, from active hosts, the top N users

sitpagehit v importer
sitpagehit allows us to collect the most active URLs at the pod level. importer doesn't allow this.
* Ask a DBA to create a query to grab the top N URIs from HOST

We need to collect the Host header from the top N 
We need to hit that URL at the webcache layer
Servers should be receiving cache from the top of the pool

What information do we need to collect to create a 'pre-cache'?
* We need to collect the Host header for the top N URIs being accessed on the
* active host. 

What information needs to be in the cache?

What format is most effective for storing the 'pre-cache'?
* We will store the pre-cache in a flat text file which will be read by the
* pre-caching program at runtime.

Where will the information for the 'pre-cache' be stored?
* we will store the pre-cache information in flat text files in a subdirectory
* of the current working directory.

Active v inactive?
